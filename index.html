<p class="font">The exact duties of a chemical engineer differ according to where they work, but they are related to the production of almost every product that is manufactured on an industrial scale.

<br><br> Chemical engineers are often tasked with researching and designing safer methods for production, pollution control and resource conservation.<br><br> As project engineers, they may be involved in the design and construction of plants and selecting the best methods and equipment to reduce production costs while maximising safety and profitability. Chemical engineers will also work to upgrade equipment and troubleshoot problems.</p>
<br><p><b>Working in both full-time or consultancy roles, the duties that a chemical engineer may undertake include:</b></p>
<br><ol class="style">
    <li>Ensuring compliance with,and improving,health and safety regulations for working with different chemicals.</li>
   <br> <li>Maintaining compliance with environmental regulations</li>
    <br><li>Researching improved manufacturing methods and systems</li>
    <br><li>Monitoring and optimising production processes</li>
    <br><li>Determining production costs</li>
   <br> <li>Recommending new equipment and designing equipment layouts</li>
</ol>

<br><p>All of these more technical aspects of the work are complemented by good interpersonal and communication skills in order to disseminate ideas across different departments and to other engineers.<br>

   <br> Many chemical engineers work within manufacturing to create enhanced products for industries including aerospace, automotive, biomedical, defence, electronic, environmental, medical and power.
    
   <br><br> Modern chemical engineering uses computer science to assist with the design and management of facilities, while chemical science principles were also influential in other fields such as genetic engineering and genomics, where it allowed for the production of DNA sequences in large quantities. </p>

<p class="font">The chemical engineering is the profession through which you can earn the manufacturing future and opportunity to serve the world. By studying in this field, you will be familiarized with the mathematics, chemistry, and biology, the knowledge of this subject will lead you to invent better products such as better quality of water, food, medicines, the energy the etc. 

<br><br> <b>Becoming a chemical engineer will let you work with the various industries and you can always have an opportunity to be at the managerial level by getting the experience and master degree.</b>
<br><br>Most chemical engineers go to university to gain a degree in chemical engineering or process engineering. Many chemical engineering graduates may opt to continue studying to post-graduate levels before entering the workplace.

<br><br>Subject modules related to chemical engineering include cell biology, environmental management, fluid mechanics, industrial chemistry, petroleum engineering, separation processes, thermodynamic, and heat, mass and momentum.

<br><br>Chemical engineering degrees typically take three years but can be longer if an industry placement is involved.The work involved in the degree will typically include writing essays and reports, laboratory-based work and experimentation, group and project work, presentations, research projects and attendance at lectures and seminars. As noted above, there could also be industry placements and work experience.

<br><br>Work experience gives you an insight into the sort of work you may be doing once you graduate, allows you to make contacts in the industry, and even improve your chances of employment with the company you are placed with.

    Chemical engineers work in a range of different locations, from research laboratories and offices to production plants and construction sites. Even when working in business and management offices, chemical engineers may also need to make visits to research or manufacturing facilities.

   <br><br> Working with large items of equipment, there is often a requirement to wear personal protective equipment such as goggles, steel-toed footwear or hard hats. Safety and hygiene is also important, particularly in food or drink production and water treatment plants.
    
   <br><br> Chemical engineering also provides opportunities to work abroad, with travel and overseas postings more likely with global manufacturing or consultancy companies than with smaller-scale national ones. 
<br><br><b>The chemical engineer has various options regarding the career choice. They can make a career in the areas such as manufacturing, research, and developments, safety or health care.</b>

    The salaries of chemical engineers vary according to role, employer, and location. However, generally-speaking, wages increase with experience.

   <br><br> For example, according to figures from JobTed in 2022, junior chemical engineering salaries start at around £26,000 per year, increasing to an average salary of £50,000 before reaching an average of £82,500 per year for senior engineers and over £150,000 for the most experienced, chartered chemical engineers.
    
   <br><br> Many chemical engineers work standard hours of 9am-5pm with some working additional hours as required. However, those working in processing and manufacturing may be need to work shifts, including evening and weekend work.
